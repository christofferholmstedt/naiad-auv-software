\section{Problem Statement}\label{ch:problem_statement}
\subsection{Bootstraping}
When starting a new system the first thing that occurs is the "Network Topology
Discovery" \cite{standard:spa_networking}. This process assigns a logical
address to each component in the network. This contradicts the CAN Bus
specification where no component is identified by a specific address.

The assumption is made that it's more important to implement SPA over CAN Bus
than it is to follow the intentions of the CAN Bus specification. The first
thing that needs to be defined is how should different components be addressed
in a local CAN Bus subnet?

% \subsection{Change of Status (COS)}
% Is it important to support Change of Status as SpaceWire does it?

% \subsubsection{Random Message ID}
% Moved to future research
% Temp text
% \subsection{Number of Message IDs used}
\subsection{Fragmentation}
How much space is needed for SPA? Traversing the SPA CAN Network.
