Abstract = {The presented work focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects concerning the design and development of a formal method to build a mission control system for autonomous underwater vehicles bringing systematic design principles for the formal description of missions using Petri nets. The proposed methodology compounds Petri net building blocks within it to de_ne a mission plan for which it is proved that formal properties, such as reachability and reusability, hold as long as these same properties are also guaranteed by each Petri net building block. To simplify the de_nition of these Petri net blocks as well as their composition, a high level language called Mission Control Language has been developed. Moreover, a methodology to ensure coordination constraints for teams of multiple robots as well as the de_nition of an interface between the proposed system and an on-board planner able to plan/replan sequences of prede_ned mission plans is included as well.

    abstract={The peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm of computing has been growing dramatically in popularity over the last decade. Consequently, large amounts of data are being shared among P2P users on a global-scale. Given the inherently untrustworthy nature of P2P networks, this paper provides a perspective concerning trust, privacy and security issues in P2P networks. Additionally, we discuss the applicability of the P2P paradigm to new application domains, the aim being to ensure that the power of the P2P paradigm goes well beyond P2Pfile-sharing interactions},
