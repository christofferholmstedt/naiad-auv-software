\section{Conclusions}
\subsection{Future work}
Bootstraping. Instead of assuming that you have to step away from the CAN Bus
specification to make SPA work...that is each component must have its own
address...maybe it's possible for a SM-c to handle many-to-many relations
between SPA components.

All components have a unique SPA logical address but within each CAN Bus subnet
messages can be read by multiple components (that is listening to the same can
bus msg id).
