-- This code handle functionalities that will be on both the CAN-link
-- firmware and in the BBB's drivers for communications with the CAN-link.
-- This code is partially based on code from the Vasa project.

-- Since this protocol is the slowest part of the can network, it has been
-- optimized by removing some of the bytes in the header. Checksum and the
-- 'bustype' bytes are removed for speed. The checksum was only a checksum
-- of the data (not the header) and there would always only be one type of
-- message making the 'bustype' byte redundant.

-- The out parameters regarding checksums are kept for compatibility but
-- will allways indicate a correct checksum.
