-- Handles the ADC for the AT90CAN. This code is based on code from the Vasa project.
-- Changes have been made since the interrupt service routine was incorrect
-- When initializing the code one sets which channels to read.
-- This way one can read only those channels one wants.

-- Edits by Nils Brynedal Ignell for the Naiad AUV project
